A raytracer built following tutorials by Peter Shirley:
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Running the program will spit out a "output.ppm" file in the same folder as main.cpp. I recommend using this online PPM viewer to easily view this image file: https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html

Currently at Chapter 7.

Built using Visual Studio 2022.
